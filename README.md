# Formula-based-user-authentication-system-

Nowadays as cyber security is a major concern for most of the web applications.So user authentication plays a very crucial role as security is concerned. In this project i have developed a "Formula/pattern based user authentication system" where during Registration/signing up user will be setting up his/her user id and formula instead of password.User would be creating a formula based on the variables who's values would be given in the form of a pin(formula pin) which will be generated by application server each time during user login. So by resolving the formula with the help of formula pin, user would be entering the password (i.e formula value). So here every time user will be authenticating by entering a different password.This code is just to simply demonstrate the idea of how an user authentication system can be made more secured by implementing formula based authentication instead of conventional password based authentication.
Considering other security aspects as well this idea should be carefully implemented in actual applications, else other security loop-holes may be created.
